# 4-Port USB Hub PCB Project
This repository contains the design files for a 4-port USB hub created using KiCad. The project includes the schematic, PCB layout, and 3D renders of the final board. The USB hub design provides an efficient and compact solution to expand USB connectivity for any device.

Project Overview
The 4-port USB hub is designed to expand a single USB connection into four individual ports, making it ideal for connecting multiple devices like flash drives, keyboards, and other peripherals to a computer.

The above image shows a 3D render of the PCB designed in KiCad. It provides a visual representation of the layout, component placement, and overall board design.

Circuit Diagram
The USB hub design is based on standard USB hub controllers with the appropriate supporting components (resistors, capacitors, diodes, and ICs) to ensure functionality and protection. Here's a high-level overview of the circuit:

USB Hub Controller: The main controller IC that manages the distribution of data across the four USB ports.
Decoupling Capacitors: Placed near the power pins of ICs to filter out noise.
Protection Diodes: Used to protect the board from voltage spikes and incorrect power connections.
Crystal Oscillator: Provides the necessary clock signal for the hub controller.
Refer to the schematic in the repository for more detailed information.
